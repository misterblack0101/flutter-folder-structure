### This project is an effort to try and find an ideal `lib/` structure for Flutter apps.

I've tried and researched several folder structures, including the "ideal" [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)  , but, I believe, after comparing the pros and cons, that it is best suited for large apps.

I found that for the projects I've worked on until now (small and medium-sized), the feature-first folder structure also doesn't work everytime, since there's alot of overlap between several app components.

Thus, after going through a lot of articles, videos and blog posts, I've compiled a folder structure that makes sense to me at the moment. 
I'll update it if I find anything else to add, or a better structure.
Any feedback/suggestions are welcome.
